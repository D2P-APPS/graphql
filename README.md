# graphql

This code allows you to jump quickly into experimenting with the GraphQL GatewayAPI. Here's how!

1. Clone this repository to a local directory
2. Using Python 3, run server.py. Everything you need _should_ be in Python3, so you shouldn't need to download anything extra.
3. Navigate a web browser to https://localhost:5000/graphql and gets started querying.



The project is built to utilize 2 APIs: AirBNB and PokéAPI. You'll be able to use AirBNB's without anything extra. Additionally, it now uses a website with an API attached to a Pokémon informational database. It's difficult to find open APIs that don't require any form of authentication, and these two have a great deal of information available to play with (without requiring any sort of registration).

Also included is a .txt file that has sample queries that you can utilize. The first two use only AirBNB queries, while the third queries both AirBNB and the PokéAPI.

Additionally, he .ipynb file is a Jupyter Notebook file that allows you can copy a multi-line query into (for easier visual while building) and it'll return the query in a single line.
