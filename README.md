# graphql

This code allows you to jump quickly into experimenting with the GraphQL GatewayAPI. Here's how!

1. Clone this repository to a local directory
2. Using Python 3, run server.py. Everything you need _should_ be in Python3, so you shouldn't need to download anything extra.
3. Navigate a web browser to https://localhost:5000/graphql and gets started querying.

The project is built to utilize 2 APIs: AirBNB and BehindTheName.com. You'll be able to use AirBNB's without anything extra. However, BehindTheName's API requires an API key to use (I may change this later to use another site if I can find another good one that does not require registration). Also included is a .txt file that has sample queries that you can utilize. The first two use only AirBNB queries, while the third queries both AirBNB and BehindTheName.com.
